# Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
This work presents an approach to help with the autism diagnosis using Machine Learning and eye-tracking. The key idea is to learn the visual patterns of eye-tracking scanpaths, and hence the diagnosis can be approached as an image classification task. Our experimental results demonstrated that the visual representation could simplify the prediction problem, and attain a high accuracy as well. With simple neural network models, our approach could realize quite promising accuracy (AUC≈91.5%).
