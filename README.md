# Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition generally characterized by social and communication impairments. The early diagnosis of ASD is highly desirable, and there is a need for developing assistive tools to support the diagnosis process in this regard. Our work presents an approach to help with the ASD diagnosis with a specific focus on children at early stages. Using Machine Learning, our approach aims to discover the eye-tracking patterns of ASD. The key idea is to transform eye-tracking movements into visual patterns, and hence the diagnosis can be approached as an image classification task. Our experimental results demonstrated that the visual representation could simplify the prediction problem, and attain a high accuracy as well. With a simple neural network model and relatively limited dataset, our approach could realize quite promising accuracy (AUCâ‰ˆ91.5%).
